        This is a code test that is meant to test your creativity and problem
        solving skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        Don't panic! We won't judge you for hacky code, we simply want you to
        solve a problem for us in any way you want.

      <p>
        This repository is a barebones setup with a Node backend and a React
        frontend. If you really want to, you can tear it all down and start from
        scratch, but this is meant to get you started immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>

      <p>
        We have configured this repository with a connection to an ElasticSearch
        node, with two prepopulated indices:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>org</code> – A collection of organizations. Accessed via{" "}
          <code>http://localhost:8080/orgs</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>funding</code> – A collection of{" "}
          <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/08/wtf-is-a-funding-round/">
            funding rounds
          </a>
          . Accessed via <code>http://localhost:8080/fundings</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The code for these endpoints can be found in{" "}
        <code>backend/src/index.js</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We want you to{" "}
        <strong>
          explore and create a chart or graph of any aspect of the data. Use any
          charting library you want or whip something up yourself if you prefer
          that. Points for creativity, both in aesthetics and in data analysis.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is a simple table version of the data. How will <em>you</em> make
        it more fun?
      </p>

      <OrgTable />

      <p style={{ color: "red" }}>Good Luck!</p>
    </div>
